## Atomic Thinking
Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. 

### 5 Stages of Atomic Design
![atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages](http://daigofuji.github.io/abcd-digipub-2014/img/atomic-web-design.gif)

#### Atoms
Atoms serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.

##### Creating an Atom
Run the Butter-CLI `create` command and follow the prompts.
```sh
butter create atom
```
Alternatively you can skip the prompts by specifying flags with the create command
```sh
butter create atom --name button-primary --group button --dna btn-primary --style button-primary
```
When the command executes three things will happen:
1. A new `~/src/materials/` file will be created: `button-primary.html` with some starter code. 
2. A new `~/src/views/` file will be created: `button.html` with code that adds your element group to the Butter menu.
3. A new `~/src/assets/toolkit/styles/themes/default/` file will be created: `_button-primary.scss` and included in your theme's `_style.scss`. 

> If any of the files already exist, they will be skipped.
> The theme in this case **default** can be changed by setting the butter config value for theme: `butter set --key theme --value "my-theme"`
