Butter is a tool for building website UI toolkits - _think ["Custom Bootstrap, for Every Client"](http://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/#tiny-bootstraps-for-every-client)_


## Quick Start

```shell
$ npm start
```

This will run the commands `$ npm install` and `$ gulp --dev` so that you can always be sure that if someone makes a
commit with a new npm module included, it will be installed on your local machine. But if you can't stand waiting the
5 seconds for npm install to check for updates, then feel free to run `$ gulp --dev` instead, just make sure
that if your build stops working you try `$ npm install` before you come crying to me.
